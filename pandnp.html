      <h4>College Level Crash Course</h4>

      <p>To start off, complexity theory is a wide field, but to generalize, it has to do with the resources used by a program during its execution. This includes both time and space complexities.</p>
      <p>Now, it is important that you are already familiar with Big-O notation. However, to give a quick summary, Big-O notation is used to give the worst-case complexity of an algorithm. Meaning, what is the slowest, worst possible time or largest amount of space this algorithm will excute and take, respecitvely. This worst-case complexity is denoted by:</p>
      <h5 id="math-notation">$$O()$$</h5>
      <p>Now, there exists several catagories for which an algorithms complexity could fall under, depending on its complexity, but the ones we will focus on are polynomial-time algorithms (P) and nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithms (NP).</p>
      <p>To begin, I will first list the polynomial-time complexities. Then the nondeterministic polynomial time algorithms. Try looking at them and see if you can recognize a pattern, then continue:</p>
      <h5 id="math-notation">$$O(1), O(n), O(n^{2}), O(n^{3}), O(n^{k})$$</h5>
      <p>Now the nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithms:</p>
      <h5 id="math-notation">$$O(2^{n}), O(3^{n}), O(n!), O(n^{n})$$</h5>
